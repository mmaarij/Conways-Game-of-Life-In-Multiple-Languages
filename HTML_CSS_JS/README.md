# Conway's Game of Life Implemented as a Web Application

## Online Demo
You can view a working version of the app [here](https://conwaysgame.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the Conway's Game of Life web app.

## Usage

- **Canvas**: The canvas displays the grid of cells representing the game board. You can click on individual cells to toggle their state (alive or dead).

- **Start/Stop Button**: Click the "Start" button to initiate or pause the simulation. The simulation automatically progresses to the next generation of cells following the rules of the game.

- **Clear Button**: Click the "Clear" button to reset the board, clearing all cells.

- **Randomize Button**: Click the "Randomize" button to randomize the initial state of the board with live and dead cells.

- **Simulation Speed**: To change the speed of the simulation (delay between generations), modify the `delay` variable in the `script.js` file.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior and appearance of the web app by modifying the JavaScript code (`script.js`) and CSS styles (`style.css`).
