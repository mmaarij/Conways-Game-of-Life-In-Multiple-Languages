# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its progression is determined by its initial state, with no further input required. The game is a classic example of emergent complexity and is known for its ability to create diverse patterns and behaviors from simple rules.

## Rules

The game is played on a grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead.

- **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).
- **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive.
- **Death**: In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead.

These simple rules give rise to complex and fascinating patterns and can be used to simulate various biological and natural phenomena.
